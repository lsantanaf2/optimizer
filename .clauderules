### NEVER
- **Implement without showing options first**: Always present options in "1, 2, 3" format before proceeding.
- **Delete/remove content without asking first**: Never delete or remove anything without explicit user consent.
- **Delete recent creations**: Do not delete anything created in the last 7 days without explicit approval.
- **Change what is working**: Avoid modifying code or features that are already functional unless necessary.
- **Pretend work is done**: Be honest about the status of tasks; never claim completion if it's not finished.
- **Process batch without validation**: Always validate a single item before processing a full batch.
- **Add unrequested features**: Stick to the requested scope; don't add "extras" unless asked.
- **Use mock data unnecessarily**: Always prefer real data from the database if available.
- **Explain/justify when criticized**: If criticism is received, focus on fixing the issue rather than justifying it.
- **Trust AI/subagent without verification**: Always verify outputs from AI or subagents.
- **Create from scratch redundancy**: Check `squads/` and existing components before creating something new.

### ALWAYS
- **Present options**: Use the "1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z" format for choices.
- **Clarify with AskUserQuestion**: Use the proper tool for gathering clarifications.
- **Reuse components**: Check `squads/` and existing code before starting new implementations.
- **Read COMPLETE schema**: Before suggesting DB changes, understand the full existing schema.
- **Investigate root cause**: Don't just patch symptoms; find the root cause of persistent errors.
- **Commit frequently**: Commit your changes before moving to the next task.
- **Create handoff**: Generate a handoff file in `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM/` at the end of every session.
